This project classifies texts as either geographic or non-geographic using the NLTK library for text pre-processing and Scikit-learn for feature extraction and classification. The workflow includes data collection, pre-processing with stop word removal and lemmatization, feature extraction  and classification with Bayes and Logistic Regression models. Replace the sample dataset with actual Wikipedia data fetched via the Wikipedia API for real-world applications.
